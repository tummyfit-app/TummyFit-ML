            "Ingredients: eggs,   milk,   olive oil,   onion,   parsley,   salted anchovies,   whole wheat flour\n",
            "Instructions: Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt. Place the noodles in boiling water, and allow 8 to 9 minutes to cook. In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, place the oil, anchovies, and onion over medium heat and cook. Stir often to break up the anchovies until a paste is formed, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the pasta and toss into the pan. Add the parsley, toss over high heat 1 minute and place on a plate. Serve immediately. To make the dough: Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and milk mixture. Using a fork, beat together the eggs and milk mixture and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated. Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits. Discard these bits. Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. To shape the Bigoli: Knead dough until smooth and tight, and let rest 20 minutes. Note: Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe. They are essential for a light pasta. Cut the dough into 6 pieces, and run each piece through a meat grinder set to the smallest extrusion size. As the pasta exits, cut it into 12-inch pieces and immediately dust with flour. Lay out onto a cookie sheet dusted with cornmeal, being careful to keep the strands separate. Finish all 6 pieces the same way.\n",

            "Instructions: Bring a pot of water to a boil and add salt and the pasta. Cook until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the cooking water before draining the pasta, and don't wash the pot.(see Use pasta water to adjust a sauce's thickness) As the pasta cooks, wilt the spinach and make the pesto in a mortar or blender as follows: Put the wet spinach in a large skillet over medium heat. Add a dash of salt, cover, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, keeping the lid on; the spinach will wilt and stay bright green. If using a blender, put in the garlic, anchovies, capers, lemon zest, the 2 Tbs. crumbledfeta, the parsley, basil, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper and blend until the pesto is creamy. If using a mortar, add the pesto ingredients one at a time, pounding with a pestle until well mashed and blended before adding the next ingredient. Thin the pesto with the reserved pasta water to get the consistency of runny cream; you probably won't have to use the entire 1/2 cup water. Return the pasta to the pot in which it was cooked; add the spinach (drain any liquid left in the pan) and the pesto, stirring very well to coat the pasta. Stir in the 2/3 cup crumbled feta and serve.\n",

            "Instructions: Carefully inspect the squash blossoms, removing any insects or debris. Gently rinse them under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. If desired, gently open the petals of each blossom and remove the stamen or pistil from the center. Be careful not to tear the blossoms. In a deep skillet or pot, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of around 350°F (175°C). In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in the sparkling water or club soda until a smooth batter forms. The batter should have a consistency similar to pancake batter. Dip each squash blossom into the batter, ensuring it is coated on all sides. Allow any excess batter to drip off. Carefully place the battered squash blossoms into the hot oil, a few at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the skillet or pot. Fry the squash blossoms for 2-3 minutes per side, or until they turn golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat the battering and frying process with the remaining squash blossoms. If desired, you can stuff the blossoms before battering them. Gently open each blossom and place a small amount of cheese, herbs, or cooked ground meat inside before sealing the petals and dipping them in the batter. Serve the Fried Squash Blossoms immediately as a delicious appetizer or side dish. They are best enjoyed while still hot and crispy.\n",

Like the dish, it is light yet bold; its subtle sweetness balances the intensity of the coriander. Try Chateau Ste.

To assess a chile's heat, slice off its top through the ribs and seeds, where the heat-producing compound capsaicin is concentrated. Touch the slice to your tongue. If you want your food to be milder, split the chile and scrape out all or some of the ribs and seeds. If your skin is sensitive, wear kitchen gloves or hold the chiles with a forkand don't touch your eyes. Note: Nutritional analysis is per serving.\n",

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in lemon and lime zests and remove from heat. Set aside 1 Tbsp. lemon-lime butter. Thoroughly brush 1 side of each fillet with remaining butter, dabbing brush so it collects some zest as well as butter. Turn and brush other side of each fish fillet. In a small bowl, mix together bread crumbs and thyme with a fork. Sprinkle equal amounts of crumb mixture over each fillet and drizzle with reserved lemon-lime butter. Bake until fish is lightly browned on top and flakes easily when pierced with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes. Garnish with lemon and lime slices and serve with sides of roasted new potatoes and steamed broccoli, if desired.\n",

            "Instructions: Drain tuna:Drain the liquid from the tuna cans. If you are using tuna packed in water, reserve a tablespoon of the tuna water, and add a teaspoon of olive oil to the tuna mixture in the next step. Mix tuna with mustard, bread, zest, lemon juice, water, parsley, chives, hot sauce, salt, pepper, egg:In a medium bowl, mix together the tuna, mustard, torn white bread, lemon zest, lemon juice, water, parsley, chives, and hot sauce. Sprinkle on salt and freshly ground black pepper. Taste the mixture before adding the egg to see if it needs more seasoning to your taste. Mix in the egg. Form into patties, chill:Divide the mixture into 4 parts. With each part, form into a ball and then flatten into a patty. Place onto a wax paper lined tray and chill for an hour. (You can skip the chilling if you want, chilling just helps the patties stay together when you cook them.) Saut in skillet: Heat the olive oil and a little butter (for taste) in a cast iron or stick-free skillet on medium high. Gently place the patties in the pan, and cook until nicely browned, 3-4 minutes on each side. Serve with wedges of lemon. You can also serve with tartar sauce on slider buns for a tuna burger.\n",
